                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._T._Rama_Rao">NTR</a>
                <p>Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (born May 28, 1923, Nimmakuru, near Machilipatnam, India—died January 18, 1996, Hyderabad) was an Indian motion-picture actor and director, politician, and government official who founded the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and served three terms (1983–84; 1984–89; and 1994–95) as chief minister (head of government) of Andhra Pradesh state in southeastern India. As an actor he rose to superstardom among the country’s Telugu-speaking people and parlayed his fame into a successful political career.

                    The man who would became popularly known as NTR was born in a small village near the coastal city of Machilipatnam (now in Andhra Pradesh) to a poor farming family. He completed a bachelor’s degree from Andhra Christian College in nearby Guntur. After qualifying for the civil service in what was then the Madras Presidency under British India, he took a job as a sub-registrar at Mangalagiri, northeast of Guntur. He soon left that post, however, to pursue a career in acting. NTR’s first film, Mana Desam, was released in 1949, and he continued to make movies until 1982, appearing in some 300 films and directing more than a dozen. He quickly demonstrated enormous popular appeal and soon attained cult-figure status. He often portrayed a Hindu god, particularly Krishna, in his movies, and his adoption of the white or saffron robes of his costumes as his everyday dress only reinforced his lofty image.</p>
